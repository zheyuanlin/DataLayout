Run make first.

Then, 
	you can run experiment 2.3 by running:
	
		experiment_2_3

	you can run experiment 3.2 by running:

		python3 experiment_3_2_write.py exp_files/test_csv.csv exp_files/test_page_file

			and

		python3 experiment_3_2_read.py exp_files/test_page_file

	I have included exp_files/ directory, which includes the test csv and page files I used.


	The experiment write ups are in report.pdf

	The results_3_2_read.csv and results_3_2_write.csv are the data I've used for my 3.2 experiment in report.pdf.
